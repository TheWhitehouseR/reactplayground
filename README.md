# reactplayground
A playground to try out different react concepts

So far it is a todo list made in react and redux.  
It supports Create, Update, Delete, Edit and Complete.

There are unit tests for most of the redux reducers but there is still a lot more to cover

Run the webpack dev server by typing npm start.  This will start webpack listening at http://localhost:8080/
This webpack server supports hot reloading, allowing you to test your changes without having to restart the server.

To run the tests, type npm test.  I still haven't managed to get test:watch working which is supposed to stay running in the background and run the tests everytime something in the folder has changed.

Have fun learning React!
